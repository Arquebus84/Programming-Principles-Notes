	//When writing java code, there are many boilerplate codes such as the setter and getter methods; it's tedious to write all
	//	of these boilderplate codes.
	
	//Project Lombok is a Java library that provides annotations to tell Java Compiler to automatically generate boilerplate code such
	//	as getters and setters methods for data fields

	//Examples of Lombok:
		//	@Getter
