	 		* A record cannot extend classes, but can implement an interface
	 		* A record cannot declare instance data fields
	 		* Parameters from the record header are automatically made as final data fields in a record. However, you can still declare
	 			static data fields in a record and you can define instance or static methods in a record
	 		* A record is implicitly final, so you cannot extend a record
