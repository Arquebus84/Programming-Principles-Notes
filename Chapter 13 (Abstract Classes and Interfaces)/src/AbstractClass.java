	 	* An abstract class cannot be contained in a non-abstract class
	 	***Abstract class cannot be instantiated using the 'new' operator (cannot create instance from an abstract class), but
	 		abstract class can be used as a data-type***
	 	
	 	* Subclass can override an abstract method from its superclass
	 	* Subclass can be abstract even if it's superclass is concrete
